<h2>if (isset($_POST['submitted'])) {</h2>

<p>book page 231-script8.3</p>

<p>script line 04</p>

<p>This is the main conditional of this form script (which both displays a form [the HTML part] and processes it). This line will check for the presents of a hidden form element (see line 67) to determine whether or not to process the form. It starts here with an "if" and then closes on line 57 just with a curly brace ( } ): it has no "else" part (because it makes only one statement).</p>

<p>This says, in effect, that "if" the hidden variable named (in script line 67 - ie in the HTML part of this script) "submitted" "isset" in the array named "$_POST" then execute the php part of this script (handle the form). Or ,by inference, "if" the hidden variable named "submitted" is NOT set, pass by the php part of this script for now and execute the HTML part (ie display the HTML form on the screen). As soon as the "submit" button of the HTML form is pushed, the "action" part of the HTML "form" tag (see script line 61) enters all of the submitted data in the "$_POST" array and sends the machine back to the php part of the script and the php part "handles" the form (ie the php part runs and processes the data.)</p>
