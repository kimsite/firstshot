<h2>if (){}</h2>

<p>book page 42 -&gt;</p>

<p>script line 04</p>

<p>"if" is a "conditional". PHP's three primary terms for creating conditionals are:
<ul>
<li>if</li>
<li>else</li>
<li>elseif (or else if)</il>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If a condition is true, the code in the following curly braces ( {} ) will be executed. If the condition is false, PHP will continue on. If there is a second condition (ie an "else if") then THAT condition will be checked for truth and so on as many times as you want until PHP hits an "else" which will be automatically executed at that point. the "else" is the default action if none of the above "if"s or "else if"s were true (therefore, "else" comes last).</p>

<p>An "if" conditional can end without an "else" part (if there is only one thing that should be true).</p>

<span class="red"><p>The curly braces used to indicate the beginning and end of a conditional are NOT required if you are executing only one statement. Use them, though, as a matter of clarity.</p></span>
