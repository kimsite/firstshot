<p>Variables always begin with a "$".</p>

<p>This is a variable being defined to dynamically name a page. It is used in the header that is "included" just below it (on the next line most likely) so that when the header IS included, the page's title is changed to whatever the variable is defined as...(Remember to put it before the inclusion of the header- or the header won't have it and so can't use it.)</p>

<span class="red"><p>Pages that are manipulated this way (ie "dynamically" generated) DO NOT index at all well on search engines!</p></span>
